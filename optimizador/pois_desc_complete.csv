Palacio Real de Madrid,"Home to the Kings of Spain from Charles III to Alfonso XIII, Madrid&#39;s Royal Palace takes us on a journey through the history of Spain. Though it is no longer the royal family&#39;s home, it continues to be their official residence.Long before Madrid became the capital of Spain, Emir Mohamed I chose Magerit (the city&#39;s Arabic name) as the site for a fortress to protect Toledo from the advancing Christians. The building was eventually used by the Kings of Castille until finally becoming what would be known as the&nbsp;Antiguo Alcázar&nbsp;(Old Fortress) in the 14th&nbsp;century. Charles I and his son Philip II turned the building into a permanent residence for the Spanish royal family. However, in 1734 a fire burnt the Palace of Los&nbsp;Austrias to the ground, and Philip V ordered the construction of the palace that stands today.Following the untimely death of&nbsp;Filippo Juvara, the architect originally commissioned to design the palace, it was his pupil Juan Bautista Sachetti who eventually drew up the final plans. Seventeen years passed between the laying of the first stone in 1738 and final completion of the work commissioned by Philip V. However, it was&nbsp;Charles III (known as the &quot;Mayor of Madrid&quot; due to the large number of reforms and initiatives that he undertook in the city) who became the first monarch to occupy the new building. His successors Charles IV (responsible for the creation of the Hall of Mirrors) and Ferdinand VII added many decorative details and furnishings, such as clocks, items of furniture and chandeliers.The palace, inspired by sketches made by Bernini for the construction of the Louvre in Paris, is built in the form of a square and looks out over a large courtyard with galleries and a parade ground. The decoration of the palace&#39;s rooms and their layout has gradually changed over the years as the building has been adapted to suit the needs of its residents.It comprises over 3000 rooms, including: the Main Staircase, designed by Sabatini with over 70 steps; the Throne Hall featuring a ceiling painted by Tiepolo; the Hall of Halberdiers, which Charles III turned into the Guards Room; the Gasparini Room, with its grand 18th&nbsp;century decoration on a floral theme; the Royal Chemist&#39;s&nbsp;with natural medicine cabinets, ceramic pots made by the&nbsp;La Granja factory, and even prescriptions given to members of the royal family; and the Royal Chapel, which is home to a collection of string instruments made by the legendary Antonio Stradivari.The Royal Armoury and the Painting GalleryThe Royal Armoury is one of the most significant collections of its kind, housing weapons and armour worn by the kings of Spain and other members of the royal family since the 13th century.&nbsp;The Painting Gallery is home to a large number of artistic treasures, including Virgin with Child&nbsp;by&nbsp;Luis Morales, Portrait of Isabella the Catholic&nbsp;by&nbsp;Juan de Flandes, Salome with the Head of John the Baptist&nbsp;by Caravaggio and works by such artists as Velázquez, Goya, Federico Madrazo and Sorolla.[[{""fid"":""145304"",""view_mode"":""full"",""fields"":{""format"":""full"",""field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]"":""La Real Cocina del Palacio Real"",""field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]"":""La Real Cocina del Palacio Real"",""field_folder[und]"":""3489""},""type"":""media"",""link_text"":null,""attributes"":{""alt"":""La Real Cocina del Palacio Real"",""title"":""La Real Cocina del Palacio Real"",""height"":335,""width"":660,""class"":""media-element file-full""}}]]&nbsp;The Royal KitchenReopened in October 2017 after a major renovation, the palace&rsquo;s splendid Real Cocina are the oldest well-preserved kitchens of a European royal residence, notable for their size and the excellent state of their accessories.

Museo Cerralbo,"This museum, one of the most important in Madrid, is also one of its least well-known. Located in what used to be the stately home of the 17th Marquis of Cerralbo, visitors to the museum are transported back in time to experience what life was like for an aristocratic family in late 19th-century Madrid. The classical style Palace, decorated with Neo-Baroque and&nbsp;Rococo elements,&nbsp;was designed with a dual purpose,&nbsp;as a home and a museum, headquarters of the works of art collected by the Marquis of &nbsp;Cerralbo and his children, the Marquises of Villa-Huerta, during their many trips in Spain and Europe. Therefore, the museum is made up of over 50,000 objects, including paintings, sculptures, ceramics, glass, tapestry, furniture, coins, medals, drawings, stamps, clocks, weapons, armour and archaeological objects...The Marquis of Cerralbo donated this property to the nation, setting up the Cerralbo Museum, so that his collections live on &ldquo;together and can be used for study by science and art lovers&rdquo;. &nbsp;Given that it is a palace-house, the different objects on display do not have any informative signs about the exhibited items (except those signs placed by the Marquis himself), during the visit, the museum offers a notebook with information and the most outstanding pieces, which is available in Spanish, English, French, Italian, Russian, Portuguese, German and Chinese. &nbsp;","C/ Ventura Rodríguez, 17, 28008 Madrid, España",956,390,60,7,6
Real Basílica de San Francisco el Grande,"This neoclassical style monumental basilica, close to the popular La Latina quarter, stands out for its artistic wealth that it houses inside, with canvases by Goya or Zurbarán, as well as its impressive dome, the largest in Spain and the fourth in Europe, behind Saint Peter&rsquo;s Basilica and the Pantheon, both in Rome, and the Basilica of Saint Mary of the Flower, in Florence.Declared a National Monument in 1980, the temple rises up, according to tradition, on the land that was offered to &nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Francis of Assisi&nbsp; following his time in Madrid in 1214 on his pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. On this site, three&nbsp; temples were erected prior to the current one, which dates back to the 18th century &nbsp;and which was carried out by the Franciscan Order. Between 1776 and 1784, its construction was completed under the &nbsp;management of Francisco Sabatini.The church consists of a central circular floor covered by a large dome &nbsp;with a diameter of &nbsp;33 metres and &nbsp;a height of 58 metres, a main chapel and six surrounding chapels also covered by domes. Inside, there is a large collection of paintings by Spanish artists from the 18th and 19th centuries, such as Goya, Zurbarán, Casto Plasencia, Francisco Jover, Martínez Cubells, José del Castillo, Moreno Carbonero, Eugenio Oliva, Menéndez Pidal, González Velázquez, Gregorio Ferro, Gaspar Crayer, Vicente Carducci, Antonio Carnicero, Alonso Cano or Lucas Jordán, as well as important sculptures in white marble.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;","Calle San Buenaventura 1 | San Buenaventura, 1, 28005 Madrid, España",646,237,59,7,7
Fundación Mapfre Recoletos,"The building that holds the exhibition halls of Mapfre Foundation was constructed between 1881 and 1884 by the architect Agustín Ortiz de Villajos, for the duchess of Medina de las Torres.The building originally consisted of a height of four floors and semi-basement, but in 1910 two towers were built in the corners. After a series of refurbishment and restructuring projects, the building now has an exhibition area with an approximate surface of 1,000 m2, divided into three halls.This foundation organises painting, sculpture and drawing exhibitions with a focus on the period spanning from the last third of the 19th century to after World War II.Mapfre Foundation has another exhibition hall in Madrid called Sala Bárbara de Braganza.

Monumento a Alfonso XII,"Located in the area of the lake in the Retiro Park, which is one of the most visited places in the park, this sculptural and architectonic ensemble pays tribute to King Alfonso XII. Opened by his son, Alfonso XIII in 1922, the monument is inspired by those designed by Victor Manuel II in Rome and William I in Berlin.Designed by the architect from Catalonia, José Grases Riera, the monument consists of a hemicycle with a dual Ionic colonnade, on whose frieze the coats of arms of the different Spanish provinces of the period are sculpted, along with scenes that are reminiscent of typical professions of the region.&nbsp; In the centre, there is a tower on which the equestrian statue of the monarch rises. At his feet, there are steps to the shore of the lake.The equestrian figure that rises up more than 20 metros high was created by the sculptor, Mariano Benlliure, author of great works, such as the sculpture of Goya, alongside the Prado Museum, or some of the pieces that decorate the façade of the Metropolis Building on the Gran Vía. The column on which it is sustained has a viewpoint from where the stately Salamanca neighbourhood, the Literary Quarter or iconic buildings on the Gran Vía can be contemplated.The General Direction Of Intervention In The Urban landscape and cultural heritage of Madrid City Council offers free guided tours to the viewpoint through its official reservation website, https://reservaspatrimonio.es/, at different times of the year.","Plaza Independencia S/N | Parque de Retiro, 28001 Madrid, España",101,76,11,1,0
Edificio Metrópolis,"Located on the corner of Calle Alcalá and Gran Vía, this emblematic building, one of the symbols of the area, was designed in 1905&nbsp;by the French architects,&nbsp;Jules&nbsp;and Raymond Février&nbsp;to house the&nbsp;La Unión and Fénix insurance company, although the final work was carried out by Luis Esteve from Spain.The Metrópolis Building is one of the main icons of the Gran Vía, featuring in thousands of tourist snapshots who photograph the view of this avenue from Plaza de Cibeles.&nbsp;Built on the site of the &ldquo;casa del ataúd&rdquo; (tomb house), so called by locals because of its narrow frontage, it was constructed between 1907 and&nbsp;1910 as the first stretch of the Gran Vía was being created, and it was officially opened on 25 January 1911.This sumptuous construction presides over the beginning of the Gran Vía with its neo-renaissance façade of Corinthian columns and a slate dome with golden incrustations, on which a statue of Victoria rises, which used to be a &nbsp;Phoenix, symbol of the insurance company that initially occupied the building.","Calle de Alcala 42, 28014 Madrid, España",523,332,75,7,3
Casa de la Panaderia,"Commissioned by Philip III, the architect Juan G&oacute;mez de Mora carried out between 1617 and 1619, a profound transformation of the old plaza del Arrabal, turning it into what is now the Plaza Mayor and giving it its main features: a rectangular square, homogeneous at the height of the village and ideal courtly representation space. 
In the centre of the north side, Gomez de Mora joined the building with the Casa de la Panader&iacute;a, modifying only the ground floor, although the height was lower than the rest of the hamlet that formed the plaza.
As the building was a symmetrical composition of four floors and arcade ground floor, with penthouse top floor and the sides crowned by angular towers. The fire of August 1672, the second to be produced in the square, completely destroyed la Casa de la Panader&iacute;a, so the architect Tom&aacute;s Rom&aacute;n undertook the project of reconstruction and the painters Claudio Coello and Jos&eacute; Jim&eacute;nez Donoso completed the interior decoration and frescoes on the fa&ccedil;ade.
Another fire in the summer of 1790 swept three-quarters of the square, but la Casa de la Panader&iacute;a was able to be saved, with its height and architectural features which became standard throughout the plaza in the reconstruction the following year undertaken by Juan de Villanueva.
Today it houses a tourist information point of the Madrid City Hall.","Plaza Mayor 27, 28012 Madrid, España",50,42,6,0,0
Puerta de Alcalá,"Erected in 1778 by Italian architect Francesco Sabatini, this triumphal gate was once the main entrance to the city. It was commissioned by King Charles III - over time nicknamed the Best Mayor of Madrid -, who was unimpressed by the gate that welcomed him when he first arrived in 1759. It is situated next to El Retiro Park in the centre of Plaza de la Independencia, a junction for three of the city&rsquo;s most well-known streets: Calle de Alcalá, the city&rsquo;s longest road, Calle de Alfonso XII, which leads to Atocha train station, and Calle de Serrano, Madrid&rsquo;s most glamorous thoroughfare.Designed by Sabatini, Puerta de Alcalá is a neoclassical triumphal arch made of granite. It was the first of its kind to be built after the fall of the Roman Empire, making it even older than Berlin&rsquo;s Brandenburg Gate or the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Unlike the smaller Puerta de Toledo and Puerta de San Vicente gates, which are also located in the centre of the city, Puerta de Alcalá has a total of five arches, not three.Each side of the gate has a different design. The one looking towards the city centre is crowned by sculptures of war trophies such as flags, weapons, breastplates and helmets, and its three rounded arches are decorated with the head of a lion. The other side, which is the one travellers would first behold when they arrived in the city, is more ornately decorated and is crowned by the royal coat of arms held up by Fame helped by a child. Along the top of the gate, you&rsquo;ll find the figures of four children that are an allegory of the cardinal virtues: fortitude, justice, temperance and prudence.The gate was given the name Puerta de Alcalá because it was on the road that led to Alcalá de Henares, Cervantes&rsquo;&nbsp;hometown.","Plaza de la Independencia, 1, 28001 Madrid, España",1334,1057,280,15,1
Fuente de Cibeles,"Cibeles Fountain has been standing in this emblematic square since 1782. One of the city&rsquo;s most famous landmarks, it depicts Cybele, the Great Mother of the gods and Roman goddess of fertility, atop a chariot drawn by two lions.It stands in the centre of the Plaza de Cibeles, the square to which it has lent its name and which marks the start of Madrid&rsquo;s avenue of art, the Paseo del Arte. The fountain is flanked by four magnificent buildings: Buenavista Palace (the Army&rsquo;s General Headquarters), Linares Palace (which accommodates the Casa de América cultural institution), Cibeles Palace (previously the main Post Office, it now houses Madrid City Hall and CentroCentro cultural centre), and the Bank of Spain. Commissioned by King Charles III it was designed by renowned Spanish architect Ventura Rodriguez. All three figures were made with purple marble from the town of Montesclaros, in Toledo, and the rest of the monument was carved from stone from Redueña, an area 53km to the north of Madrid, close to the La Cabrera mountain range.When it was first erected, the monument was not only intended to be decorative but also functional, providing water for the official water carriers &ndash; who would deliver water to houses &ndash; and for the general public. It was also used by the cavalry as a water stop for their horses. Today, as well as being one of the city&rsquo;s famous landmarks (and having an identical twin in Mexico City), it&rsquo;s where you should head to if you want to join Real Madrid fans celebrating their team&rsquo;s many victories.","Plaza de Cibeles, Madrid, España",595,409,160,15,5
Palacio de Gaviria,"This 19th-century palace is located on Calle Arenal, a stone&rsquo;s throw from Puerta del Sol. Built between 1846 and 1847 by architect Aníbal Álvarez Bouquel, it was commissioned by banker and stockbroker Manuel Gaviria y Douza, Marquis of Gaviria. One of the most sumptuous palaces of its time, it is an example of Palazzo style architecture.Inaugurated by Queen Isabel II in 1851, it was well-known for the parties it hosted, which could be seen by passers-by through the balconies. Boasting a wonderful interior, particularly noteworthy are the frescoes in the exhibitions rooms, painted by Joaquín Espalter y Rull. The building was declared a Place of Cultural Interest in 1977.Between&nbsp;1991 and 2011, it housed one of the city&rsquo;s most popular nightclubs. After a large renovation, it reopened in 2017 as an exhibition space for Arthemisia, an Italian company specialising in the production, organisation and staging of major exhibitions.","Calle del Arenal 9, 28013 Madrid, España",60,52,15,6,2
Puerta del Sol,"This bustling square located bang in the centre of Madrid is one of the city&rsquo;s most famous sites. With its semi-circular shape, it is a junction for many of the city&rsquo;s historical and busiest streets such as Mayor, Arenal, Alcalá and Preciados, as well as the starting point for all major radial roads in Spain. Originally the site of one of the city&rsquo;s gates, Puerta del Sol should be at the top of your list of places to visit. Sitting atop the Casa de Correos building, the current headquarters of the Madrid regional government, you&rsquo;ll find the famous clock that all eyes turn to on the last day of the year. For over a century now tradition has it that people across the country usher in the New Year by eating 12 lucky grapes to the twelve chimes of midnight struck by this clock.A stone slab on the pavement in front of the main entrance to the Casa de Correos marks Spain&rsquo;s Kilometre 0, the starting point for all major radial roads in Spain. Across the square, at the beginning of Calle Alcalá, Madrid&rsquo;s longest street, you&rsquo;ll find the famous Oso y Madroño. The official symbol of the city, the statue of a bear nuzzling a strawberry tree is a popular meeting spot for Madrileños.On the other side of the square, at the start of Calle Arenal which leads to the Teatro Real opera house, stands a copy of La Mariblanca statue. The original, which dates back to the 17th century and once adorned a fountain in this very spot, is now stored in Casa de la Villa. Puerta del Sol&rsquo;s third and largest statue is found in the centre of the square and depicts King Charles III of Spain on horseback. During his reign, the monarch introduced so many progressive reforms and gave the city such a makeover that he earned the moniker Madrid&rsquo;s best mayor.","Puerta del Sol, 28013 Madrid, España",2518,2089,925,168,64
Plaza de la Villa,"Plaza de la Villa is one of Madrid&rsquo;s best-preserved historical monuments. It is located in the historical zone, next to the Puerta del Sol Gate, and up until not long ago, you could find there the site of the capital City Council. It was one of the main medieval centers of Madrid, since three streets start there, corresponding to the original city design: Codo, Cordón and Madrid. In its outskirts are the main façades of three buildings with high historical-artistic value, built in different centuries. The oldest one is The Lujanes&rsquo; House and Tower (15th century), built with a Gothic-Mudejar style, located on the eastern side of the Plaza. This is now the office of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences. Following in chronological order, one can see the Cisneros&rsquo; House (16th century), a Plateresque palace completing the southern part of the enclosure, and the Casa de la Villa (17th century), with a Baroque style, one of the sites of the Madrid City Council, situated on the western side of the Plaza.&nbsp;In the 15th century, the Plaza adopted its current name, at the same time receiving the title of Noble and Loyal Villa from by Madrid, from the King Henry IV of Castile himself (1425-1474). On the three hundredth anniversary of Admiral Don Álvaro de Bazán&rsquo;s (1526-1588) death, in 1888, the City Council decided to build a monument in his memory. However, it was not inaugurated until December, 19th, 1891. Since then, it has been located in the center of the Plaza, and nowadays it is surrounded by a large ornamental flower garden.","Calle Mayor, Madrid, España",110,141,46,2,0
Fuente de Neptuno,"Together with Cibeles Fountain, Neptuno Fountain is one of the most beautiful and majestic fountains in Madrid. Both gods occupy prominent positions within Greek mythological hierarchy and are rivals on the sports field, since the followers of Atlético de Madrid celebrate their victories in the square that plays tribute to&nbsp;the god of the sea, while those of Real Madrid do so in the Plaza de la Cibeles. As part of the original project of Ventura Rodríguez, both fountains were placed facing each other on either side of the Paseo del Prado. At the end of the 19th century, both Cibeles and Neptuno underwent a restoration process and were moved, finally occupying the centre of the squares Plaza de la Cibeles and Plaza de Cánovas del Castillo, respectively.The authorship of the sculpture is not very clear, since it was commissioned to sculptor Juan Pascual de Mena, who died before the completion of the piece; however, documents exist which indicate the work was continued by his apprentice José Arias. Regarding the whole monument, a carriage in the form of a shell emerges from a rocky base and is pulled by two hippocampi, symbol of storms and agitated sea. The sculpture represents the god of the sea with his trident upon a chariot, pulled by two sea horses.Together with the fountain of Apolo, or the Four Seasons, and that of Cibeles, it formed part of the decoration for the &#39;Salón del Prado&#39; exhibition, a project commissioned by King Charles III. Plaza de Neptuno occupies a central spot in the Paseo del Prado, where the Westin Palace and the Ritz -two of Madrid&#39;s most historic hotels- are situated.","Paseo del Prado | Plaza de Canovas del Castillo, 28014 Madrid, España",144,163,49,3,3

The latter deteriorated badly during the nineteenth century and, following an agreement with the ecclesiastical authorities, it was restored and became part of the Prado Museum in the extension designed by architect Rafael Moneo.

Congreso de los Diputados,"The Palacio de las Cortes Españolas, Spain&rsquo;s parliament, in the Plaza de las Cortes, was built on the site of the former convent of Espíritu Santo. No longer occupied by the monks, it was used as the headquarters for the Congress between 1834 and 1841, before which time the Congress had no fixed address. The tender put out for the construction of the current building was awarded to the architect Narciso Pascual y Colomer, and construction work was finished in 1850. On the main façade, a flight of stairs climbs up to the neoclassical portico It features six imposing fluted Corinthian columns which support the triangular pediment, decorated with reliefs by Ponciano Ponzano.

Edificio Telefónica,"The Telefónica Building was officially opened in 1930 as part of the project to build the Gran Vía; back then it was Europe&#39;s tallest building, standing nearly 90 metres high, and its design was inspired by the skyscrapers of America. It became the country&#39;s most important communications centre and a workplace for more than 1,800 employees, including the famous switchboard operators. The first transatlantic telephone call in Spain was made from here, connecting King Alfonso XIII with United States president Calvin Coolidge.During the Spanish Civil War, the building&#39;s strategic position and impressive size made it both a target for enemy bombs and an air-raid shelter for the people of Madrid. It was also a working base for foreign correspondents covering the war, such as Ernest Hemingway and John Dos Passos, who sent their reports from here.Nowadays, the Telefónica Building is home to the Espacio Fundación Telefónica, a centre for cultural activity and debate, hosting exhibitions, workshops and meetings, especially events focusing on cutting-edge art and technology.","Calle Gran Via 28, 28004 Madrid, España",32,31,13,1,1
Puente de Segovia,"This is the oldest bridge in Madrid and it crosses over the Manzanares River on the way from Segovia, one of the main access points to the capital. Its construction began in 1574, according to the Provision of Philip II, by Construction Foreman Gaspar de Vega, who made the designs and established the conditions of execution. Upon the architect’s death in 1577, with the bridge only at its foundations, Juan de Herrera took charge of the project and created new designs. He changed the medieval designs and planned the first modern bridge: the gradient is horizontal. The bridge is formed by nine semicircular arches and built with granite ashlars.&nbsp;The Bridge has undergone several repairs throughout its history, with the intervention of notable architects. Between 1935 and 1943, it was worked on by the Gabinete de Accesos y Extrarradio and after the Civil War by the Jefatura de Obras Públicas. In the latter’s name, engineer Vicente Olmos increased the width from 28 to 101 feet, dividing the bridge in two and opening it.Between 1955 and 1960, the same engineer restored the original elevations for the channelling of the Manzanares by digging up pillars and adding new lateral arches with its basins. As the Bridge was affected by the layout of the M-30, architects Pérez-Aciego and Quesada carried out remodelling projects for the access and lateral roads in 1985.","Paseo de la Virgen del Puerto | Puerta del Angel, Madrid, España",24,25,8,2,0
Puerta de Toledo,"The Puerta de Toledo gate was built to commemorate the arrival in Madrid of Fernando VII, &#39;the Desired One&#39;. It appears that the project for the gate was carried out under the reign of José Bonaparte, although the return of Fernando VII to the throne put it on halt; its construction was later entrusted to Antonio López Aguado. López Aguado used granite and stone from Colmenar to build a gate in Neo-Roman style and it was completed in 1827. With three arches, two lateral square arches and one central semi-circular arch, the Puerta de Toledo gate has openings flanked by half-columns with Ionic capitals in the central arch and Ionic pilasters in the others.On the side facing the Manzanares River, a group of sculptures made by Valeriano Salvatierra and Ramón Barba was installed above the central arch. These sculptures represent the power of the Spanish monarchy on both hemispheres. Also on this side, in the upper part of the other two arches, several military trophies were placed. Finally, on the opposite side of the monument, two angels support the emblem of the City of Madrid.","Madrid, España",57,88,69,5,1

Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de la Concepción,"Work began on this beautiful church in 1902, following a project by the architect Eugenio Jiménez Corera, and it was finished after his death by Jesús Carrasco in 1914. It is located on Calle Goya, in the heart of the Salamanca district.With regard to the building, it was built in Neo-Gothic style over the longitudinal plan of three naves. What most attracts our attention is the huge 44-metre-high tower at its foot, crowned by a large iron spike upon which there is an image of the Virgin Mary. According to Pedro de Répide, this was at first surrounded by a halo of electric lightbulbs, which was more appropriate for the entrance to a theatre than to a sacred place.

It is located over an older chapel, possibly built by Alfonso VIII, on a plot in La Latina, owned almost entirely by one of the most powerful families in Madrid, the Vargas family.&nbsp;It was precisely a member of this family, Francisco de Vargas, who commissioned the building of the chapel in 1520. Work was finished on it in 1535 by his son Don Gutierre de Vargas y Carvajal, the Bishop of Plasencia, and from whom the chapel took the name by which it is most popularly known, since its real name is the Chapel of San Juan de Letrán.It is a splendid building, representing the transition from the Gothic style (nave and apse, roof with Gothic ribbed vaults) to the Renaissance style (door and interior decoration). Built as a chapel belonging to the church of San Andrés, to which it was originally joined, inside it has a magnificent main altarpiece, the work of Francisco de Giralte from Palencia and a disciple of Berruguete, who completed it around 1550 with the collaboration of Juan Villoldo el Mozo, who did the colouring work.","Plaza Paja 9, 28005 Madrid, España",24,11,1,0,0

Iglesia de San José,"This church once belonged to the former convent of San Hermenegildo, established in 1586 by Friar Nicolás de Jesús y María, which was known as the Carmen Descalzo Convent since it was home to members of said religious order. The original building, whose church was built in 1605, was demolished in the early 18th century, and in 1730 Pedro de Ribera commissioned the construction of the contemporary building, which was completed in 1748 by José de Arredondo and Fausto Manso. The construction has a typical church layout designed following Madrid Baroque aesthetics: a Latin cross plan with a central nave and two lateral ones.The façade, built in a Ribera style, has a central niche with an image of Nuestra Señora del Carmen created by French sculptor Roberto Michel. The original façade was altered in 1912 by architect Juan Moya e Idígoras to extend it outwards and upwards and adapt it to the proportions of the adjacent &ldquo;Casa del párroco&rdquo; (Parish priest house), also built around this period to celebrate the opening of Gran Vía.In 1836, after the Mendizábal confiscation, the Carmelites were expelled and both the convent and the temple were left empty and given no other use. The convent housed the Military Administration Direction for several years but was knocked down to make way for the Teatro Apolo and then the Banco de Vizcaya building. The church, however, became the site for the Parish of San José, and continues to function as such at present.","Calle Alcala 43, 28004 Madrid, España",17,20,5,0,0

The convent keeps important pictorial and sculpture collections from the 17th and 18th Centuries, with works done by Lucas Jordán, Juan Van der Hammen, Vicente Carducho, Gregorio Fernández, and Pedro de Mena. Also deserving of a special mention is the reliquary that houses a group of 700 pieces made of bronze, coral, ivory, and fine wood from Italy, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands.Ventura Rodríguez renovated the church in 1761. The Confiscation of 1836 notably affected the convent, since the nuns were removed from the convent in 1842 and its progressive demolition followed. In 1844, the architect charged with clearing the space of rubble and debris was Narciso Pascual y Colomer. The convent reconstruction project was also designed in 1844, mainly in the San Quintín street wing, and initiated in 1847, when the nuns returned to the building after five years of exile from the convent.","Plaza Encarnacion 1, 28013 Madrid, España",39,27,12,4,2

The convent was demolished in 1868, during the Glorious Revolution, only the church remaining standing.&nbsp; It was built between 1670 and 1678 according to a design by Fray Lorenzo de San Nicolás, although it was completed by Isidro Martínez and Gregorio Garrote.

Inside, the magnificent altarpiece created by José Benito de Churriguera between 1720 and 1724, with sculptures by Pablo González Velázquez, is of exceptional interest.The present day façade is quite different from the original, as during the reign of Isabella II it was completely remodelled by the architect Juan de Madrazo y Kuntz on the orders of the king consort, Francisco de Asís. The change consisted in applying a red terracotta colour to the whole façade and introducing neo-Renaissance decorations, largely inspired by the architecture of Milan, such as the rose window in the central section reproducing the cross of Calatrava.","Calle Alcala 25, 28013 Madrid, España",11,15,5,0,0

Municipal architect López Salaberry was responsible for this project, and he also requested permission for the unused pillars to be valued and auctioned.Proposals were put forward at various times for the reconstruction of the Puerta de San Vicente. Maria Cristina, the queen regent, repeatedly expressed a desire that the gate should once again grace the city. Later, in 1692, the city council passed a motion for a reproduction of the monument valued at a million pesetas (6,000 &euro;) to be constructed.

On 23 April of that same year, when the demolition of the house in question was about to begin, Ramón de Mesonero Romanos wrote in the only literary newspaper of the era a short article in memory of the writer and on the matter of the demolition. This article attracted the attention of King Fernando VII, who proposed that the work be suspended so that the State could purchase the building. But the proprietor refused to cede and the demolition was carried out. Once the new building had been finished - the entrance of which was no longer in Calle del León but in Calle Francos - a relief was placed on the façade with the bust of Cervantes and an inscription commemorating his stay and death in that place.

Monumento a Felipe IV,"Work on this sculptural ensemble in the centre of the gardens in Plaza de Oriente began in the seventeenth century. It is dedicated to King Philip IV and the main statue, in bronze, represents the king on horseback, in a difficult composition which is the work of Italian sculptor Pietro Tacca. He based it on a design by Velázquez and Galileo Galilei acted as scientific advisor to ensure the stability of the statue. This was no simple matter, as it was the first equestrian statue in the world supported on the back legs of a horse (the tail provides inconspicuous additional support). This design was chosen because Philip IV wanted a sculpture that was better than that of his father Philip III in Plaza Mayor. It was thus decided that a statue should be created featuring a horse on its hind legs, something that had never been achieved before.The statue stood in various sites until 1843, during the reign of Isabella II, when it was transferred from the Retiro park to its present location, as recorded on the two marble plaques on the pedestal. It was then that the two bas-relief panels were added at the base of the statue. One shows Philip IV presenting the Cross of Santiago to Velázquez and the other is an allegorical reference to the monarch&#39;s role as a patron of the arts. The ensemble also includes two large shell-shaped fountains, a figure that depicts a river, and four bronze lions.","Plaza de Oriente, Madrid, España",27,39,13,0,0

Urquijo, the current building was erected, which housed the nuns once again shortly afterwards.","Paseo Recoletos 11, 28004 Madrid, España",1,7,2,0,0
Real Iglesia Parroquial de Santiago y San Juan Bautista,"On the very spot where today we find&nbsp;Santiago Church, there once stood one of the oldest churches in Madrid, which appeared in the city law books in 1202. Despite this, the original church was destroyed and rebuilt in the 19th century by architect Juan Antonio Cuervo, assistant to Ventura Rodríguez. Due to its square design, the church doesn&#39;t look like a religious building. In neoclassical style, its most interesting feature is its location: on&nbsp;Plaza de Santiago, in the heart of&nbsp;Hapsburg Madrid.&nbsp;","Plaza de Santiago, 28630 Madrid, España",6,8,4,0,0
Parroquia de San Fermín de los Navarros,"Located in the district of Chamberí, this Neo-Gothic church was built between 1886 and 1890 under the direction of architect Eugenio Jiménez Corera, at the request of the Royal Congregation of San Fermín de los Navarros.The church is laid out in the form of a Latin cross and transept, with a star rib vault in the high central nave, accompanied by two lower lateral naves on the sides of the transept. They all have large gates that form small entrance atriums. The gothic style was adopted in the interior of the church. The walls are whitewashed imitating stone, with details picked out in gold ink lines. The stain glass windows, set within horseshoe arches, represent the coat of arms of Navarre, among other representations.&nbsp;The outside of the church is in the Neo-Mudejar style of Toledo, with rapidly-built and low-cost brick architecture that became very popular in Madrid as the city expanded, and indeed the Neo-Mudejar style could even be considered a typical style of Madrid.","Paseo Eduardo Dato 10, 28010 Madrid, España",4,2,13,0,0
Consejo de Estado,"Located in Hapsburg Madrid, this palace is one of the few examples that remain of noble residential architecture from the 17th century. It is still not known for certain who designed it, but there are some intellectuals who attribute its lines to the famous Madrid architect Francisco de Mora and others to Captain Alonso de Trujillo, who built the Villa de Lerma. What they do agree on is that the architect Juan Gómez de Mora, nephew of the aforementioned Francisco, took part in its construction from the time the work started in 1611. It was conceived with a certain similarity to the Hapsburg Alcázar, as it had the appearance of a fort; it had two interior patios; and no shortage of spires in the Flemish style, which have now disappeared. In 1615, the duke founded the Santísimo Sacramento Convent as an annex to the palace. As a whole, its shape and size reflected the magnificence and power of the Duke of Uceda in the times of Felipe III. Currently, this magnificent building houses the offices of the&nbsp;Council of State.","Calle Mayor 79, 28013 Madrid, España",0,0,0,0,0

Iglesia parroquial de San Millán y San Cayetano.,"This church was built by the architect Marcos López in 1669 and finished by Francisco de Moradillo in 1761; it is also believed that José de Churriguera and Pedro de Ribera took part in the project. Located in the Latina district, it is laid out in the shape of a Greek cross and is crowned with a large dome on a drum over Byzantine-style pendentives. The inside has three naves and four closed chapels with their corresponding domes. The fa&shy;çade was built in granite and has been attributed to Churriguera.

Monasterio De Montserrat,"It has been many years since the church of Our Lady of Montserrat stopped the tradition of ringing its bells at midnight for the soul of king Philip V. The bells were rung at this time as it was the time that the Benedictine monks heard of the death of their monarch and the founder of the abbey as it then was. The church, in the centre of the Conde Duque district, was on course to be one of the largest and most majestic churches of its time. But it was never completed. You only have to look up to see that. Even the most unobservant will notice that there is only one tower. The other was never built.The church of Montserrat was founded by Spanish Benedictine monks who had been expelled from the monastery of Montserrat in Barcelona in 1640. Work on the church stopped in 1720 and was never completed. The church was designed by Sebastián Herrera Barnuevo, although after his death other architects took over the project. Among those was Pedro de Ribera, who built the tower and the façade. Another of his façades is the one near the Conde Duque Cultural Centre, one of the neighbourhood&#39;s artistic landmarks. After the Mendizábal disentailment of 1836, the church became a women&#39;s prison and later a dance hall. The Benedictines reoccupied it in 1914.

Bunker del Jardin Del Capricho,"Before us is one of the green spaces that make up the natural artistic heritage of Madrid. It is one of the most beautiful and, paradoxically, one of the least known. The Duke and Duchess of Osuna--especially by the Duchess, María Josefa de la Soledad Alonso Pimentel, created it in 1784. As a protector of artists, bullfighters, and intellectuals, the Duchess created an authentic natural paradise frequently visited by the most distinguished personalities of the period, and where the most prestigious artists, gardeners, and set designers worked. After the death of the Duchess, the Park began to lose popularity, a situation that continued until 1974 when the Madrid City Council bought the Park and began its restoration, which finished in 1999. The Park houses important botanical, sculptural, and artistic treasures. Among them are shrines, hermitages, fountains, small plazas, and the palace of dukes, among others. The garden is composed of three sections: the parterre or French garden, the English landscape, and the Italian giardino.The parterre lies in front of the west façade of the palace, with its trimmed hedges embroidering the lawn. The Italian garden is in the lower section, the oldest part of the original property, where the hedges are combined with trees under which people can sit in the sun during winter, or take shelter from it in the summer. Nearby, the labyrinth, created for amorous play as well as hide-and-seek, is made up of laurel trees and is consistent with the original plans used for the seeding and planting during the period in which the Duchess was still alive. And lastly, the remainder of the Park is designed as a typical English landscape garden, evoking nature in its pure state and suggesting leisurely walks and discovery of hidden places.Visit the bunker at El Capricho Park&nbsp;El Capricho keeps a secret: the well-known bunker of the Jaca Position, the only example in Europe of this kind of structures from the Spanish Civil War. The bunker was home to the headquarters of the Republican Army of the Central Region. Covering 2000m2, the shelter is covered by 15m-deep soil and offered protection against bombs of up to 100kg. It was built in the park in 1937 on a site that was far away from the front line, had excellent communication infrastructures and was surrounded by trees and bushes that would provide concealment.The shelter has seven rectangular rooms (four to the right and three to the left), four exits to the park and a gallery reaching the street that runs across the basement of the Duques de Osuna Palace.The Directorate General of Intervention Urban Landscape and the Cultural Heritage Department of Madrid City Council offers free 30-minute guided tours (20 people per group) on Saturdays and Sundays, prior reservation required&nbsp;on the&nbsp;official reservations website.","Paseo de Alameda de Osuna, 28042 Madrid, España",1,1,0,0,0
Templo de Debod,"This is an Egyptian temple dating back to the 2nd century BC, transported to Madrid&rsquo;s Cuartel de la Montaña Park. The temple was donated to Spain by the Egyptian government to save it from floods following the construction of the great Aswan Dam. Works on the temple began at the beginning of the 2nd century BC at the orders of the Meroë King Adijalamani, who built a chapel dedicated to the god Amun and the goddess Isis. This chapel was decorated with high reliefs. Subsequent kings of the Ptolemaic dynasty built new rooms around the original core, thereby enlarging the temple. After Egypt was annexed by the Roman Empire, the emperors Augustus and Tiberius &ndash; and possibly Hadrian, too &ndash; finished off the construction and decoration of the building.In the 6th century AD, following Nubia&rsquo;s conversion to Christianity, the temple was sealed off and abandoned. In the 20th century, owing to the construction of the dam, the Egyptian government gave the temple as a gift to the city of Madrid and it was transported and rebuilt stone by stone in its current location. It was opened to the public in 1972. The reconstruction in Madrid kept the building&rsquo;s original orientation; that is to say, from East to West. To help visitors understand the meaning of this magnificent location, its decorative motifs and its history, scale models and videos can be seen and audiovisual material is projected on the walls.The inside of the monument is currently closed to visitors, although you can still walk along the walkway during the temple opening hours.","Calle Ferraz 1, 28008 Madrid, España",4337,2634,993,127,35
Ermita De San António De La Florida,"With its sober appearance, the San Antonio de la Florida Chapel is a contrast to the grandiose pictorial ensemble that Goya painted at the end of the 18th Century. In creating this masterpiece of Spanish art, the artist from Aragón knew that he was decorating one of the most popular temples of Madrid, famous for its celebration each June 13th. The original chapel, devoted to San Antonio de Padua,&nbsp;was built in front of the Abanico fountain under the orders of Carlos IV.&nbsp;It was created by Francisco de Fontana (1792 - 1798), and it has a Greek cross ground plan, short arms, and a semicircular apse from the top of which originates a central space dominated by a big dome and illuminated by a lantern. The chapel is confined to areas attached to the exterior, forming a rectangle. Standing out from this are the supports, which showcase the main façade, built according to the Baroque canon.As a result of the special concern that has always existed to ensure its conservation, in 1905 it was declared National Monument, and in 1928 an identical temple was built next to it in order to move the services there, and thus preserve the original as a museum dedicated to Goya. In spite of being one of the best neoclassic examples in Madrid, it is the frescos by Goya that makes San Antonio chapel a place to visit in Madrid, as well as being the place where the artist has been laid to rest since 1919.&nbsp;Goya decorated the dome with frescos representing the Saint&rsquo;s trance before the people of Lisbon. The altarpieces were later painted by Jacinto Gómez Pastor.","Glorieta de San Antonio de La Florida 4, 28008 Madrid, España",419,205,48,4,4

That is why it is next to what is now the Prado Museum, which was built in the late 18th century to house the Museum of Natural History.
